Guidelines for creating Installer Modules
=========================================

A) Project creation
  1. In order to create an Installer module you must create a class that implements Findwise.SolutionInstaller.IInstallerModule interface.
  2. For your convenience, there's an abstract class Findwise.InstallerModule.InstallerModuleBase that already implements several IInstallerModule interface members.
  3. The project type must be a Class Library since the Plugin Manager will look for modules that are in .dll files.
  4. To maintain solution integrity, all Installer Modules are required to be placed in InstallerModules folder, not only Visual Studio virtual folder but also physically on disk.
     To do so:
      - Create a Class Library project directly under the solution
      - Remove it from solution
      - Open the solution folder in file explorer
      - Move the project folder to InstallerModules folder
      - Add existing project under InstallerModules folder in Solution Explorer and choose your newly added project.
  5. One project (assembly) can contain multiple Installer Module classes. All of them will be resolved by the Plugin Manager.

B) Source code
  1. It is strongly recomended to add a reference to log4net assembly (the easiest and best way to do this is to use Manage Packages for Solutions window (Installed tab) under Tools>Nuget Package Manager),
     add an ILog object to every Installer Module, create the ILog object with the module type (example below) and log all significant activities.
	 Example:
	    private readonly ILog logger;
        public .ctor() //Your Installer Module class constructor
        {
            logger = LogManager.GetLogger(GetType());
        }
  2. If you want to execute some operations during project Save/Load, implement Findwise.SolutionInstaller.ISaveLoadAware interface.
     Don't leave the throw new NotImplementedException() snippet though.
  3. If you want (it is most most likely you would) to add your own Installer Module Configuration, create a new class that inherits from Findwise.Configuration.ConfigurationBase 
     and let the instance of this class to be get/set by the Configuration property.
  4. Both Installer Module and its Configuration classes must be public in order to be properly resolved/serialized.
  5. It is strongly recomended that at the beginning of every IInstallerModule operation the Status property is set to appropriate value.
     It is also recomended that in case of an exception in the IInstallerModule operation, the exception is caught, the property Status is set to Error and then the exception is rethrown.
  6. It is acceptable if you use MessageBox to show some dialog boxes in Uninstall methods, in a moderate way of course, to warn user before some destructive operations for example.
     If the operation is too destructive, feel free to throw NotImplementedException with adequate message or just display a MessageBox with the information and not implement the actual method.
  7. It is strongly recomended to NOT to display a MessageBox in Install methods as they are intended to be executed uninteruptibly in a batch.
